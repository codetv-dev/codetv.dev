## Press 1 for an awesome AI-Powered Hotline

**Ever thought: gee, I wish there was a hotline for that? Well now’s your chance to build it!**

Think: an office-hours hotline, community resources line, pizza-ordering line, event status line, bug triage, wake‑up calls, volunteer coordination, campus shuttle tracker — if it rings it fits.

## The Tool: ConversationRelay

**Your hotline must use [ConversationRelay](https://twil.io/cr) as part of the build.**

Twilio’s ConversationRelay lets you place a relay layer between callers and your logic so you can route messages, swap in bots or humans, and keep a clean separation of concerns.

Use it with Twilio Programmable Voice and/or Messaging (SMS/WhatsApp), webhooks, and your runtime of choice (Twilio Functions/Studio/Serverless or your own stack).

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

The Twilio team has set up a [dedicated channel](https://discord.gg/6ERg5HDkXG) on the Twilio Discord for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://codetv.link/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
</Aside>

## Multiple Ways to Win!

The Twilio team will choose three built hotline submissions to win some great Twilio swag from our [merch store](https://store.twilio.com/) and Twilio credits.

The first five qualifying hotlines submitted will also receive an item of their choice (up to $150) from Ugmonk, Drop, or Cocoon.

Finally, whether you’ve built a hotline or just have a great idea, share it in [the challenge thread on Twilio's X account][submit]. The top five ideas by total likes, comments, and reshares at the deadline will each receive a gift card valued at $25. As a bonus, we will be building one standout idea live on Twitch with Alex and Jason.

<Aside>
  **Note:** Shipping is limited to countries where Ugmonk, Drop, and Cocoon are able to deliver. See their websites for specifics.
