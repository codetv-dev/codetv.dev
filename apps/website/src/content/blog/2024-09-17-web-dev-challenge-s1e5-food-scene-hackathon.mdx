## The prompt: make something that gets people excited about their local food scene.

The way restaurants run changed in a big way during the pandemic. The big food delivery apps control which restaurants get seen, and social media algorithm changes make it harder than ever for these businesses to get noticed. Your challenge is to come up with some way of getting more people to notice — and get involved in — their local food scene.

This can be anything web-based, whether you want to create some way for people to discover new restaurants and chefs, create an event or a social game, or even tackle the notoriously awful restaurant website design aesthetic.

Apps must use [Convex][sponsor], [Clerk][sponsor2], and/or [Raycast][sponsor3] as part of the build. 


## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [Learn With Jason Discord](https://lwj.dev/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://lwj.dev/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
</Aside>

Find an accountabilibuddy, get expert guidance from the Clerk, Convex, and Raycast teams, run your idea past Jason and other community members, and listen in to what the rest of the community is cooking up in this open call to kick off the hackathon.

RSVP to add it to your calendar:

  ¹ The time limit is intended to make this a quick project that can fit most schedules. That being said, if you decide to spend more time on this, we'll never let a silly thing like rules stand in the way of a good time.
