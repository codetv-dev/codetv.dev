	**Heads up!** This episode was a special collaboration with RenderATL. Thanks to Justin and team for lining up the venue and in-person hackathon! [Get tickets to RenderATL 2025][render] and come hang out with me and a ton of other great folks!

## The prompt: Come up with ways to connect people’s behavior to e-commerce incentives

Creating brand loyalty is everything to an e-commerce store. Our friends at [Blvck Spades][blvck-spades] have a great product, and they need help coming up with ways to incentivize users to interact with their brand.

Your challenge is to build software that connects a user’s activity to incentives. Beyond an e-commerce store, many businesses might have an app, partnerships, or physical locations or events — our job is to connect a user’s activity in these other places to incentives in the e-commerce store using the Mailchimp users as the source of truth.

For example, something like “play 10 rounds of our game and get 10% off your order in the store”, or “show up to a local meetup and earn an exclusive, limited edition t-shirt”.

<Aside>
	**IMPORTANT:** You _do not_ have to build the full e-commerce store part of this! In fact, it’s probably not possible given the time constraint. Instead, focus on building the fun interaction thing and making the note in Mailchimp that the user has done the thing that earns the incentive.
</Aside>

Apps must use [Mailchimp][sponsor] as part of the build. 

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [Learn With Jason Discord](https://lwj.dev/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://lwj.dev/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
</Aside>

Find an accountabilibuddy, get expert guidance from the industry professionals, run your idea past Jason and other community members, and listen in to what the rest of the community is cooking up in this open call to kick off the hackathon.

RSVP to add it to your calendar:
