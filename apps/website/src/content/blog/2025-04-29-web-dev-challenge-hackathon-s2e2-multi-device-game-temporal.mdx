## The prompt: Build a game that’s played on at least 2 devices.

Single player, multiplayer, cooperative, competitive, or something totally different — your challenge is to come up with something fun that is played across at least two devices. Temporal’s workflow tools will allow you to manage sending information between devices dependably.

Your game could be something like Jackbox, where a tv is the “game board” and each player’s phone is how they interact with it on their turn. You could make a game that uses phone APIs like the camera or gyroscope. Or you can implement a simple word game like the New York Times connection puzzles, but with the twist that it's designed to be solved collaboratively, and a session can persist beyond the players closing the web app.

Get creative and have fun with it!

Apps must use [Temporal][sponsor] as part of the build. 

## Introduction to Temporal + devs discuss their ideas

In the kickoff call for this hackathon, Alex Garnett from Temporal gives an overview of how Temporal works, including a live coded demo, and answers questions from developers.

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [CodeTV Discord](https://codetv.link/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://codetv.link/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
