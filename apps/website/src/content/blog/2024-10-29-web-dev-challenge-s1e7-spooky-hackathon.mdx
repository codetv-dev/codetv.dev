## The prompt: build an app that’s haunted. Make it spooky, make it creepy — let’s have a little Halloween fun.

Your app should get into the Halloween spirit in its functionality, user experience, or design. The specifics are up to you: it can be fun or funny, like a Scooby-Doo episode; it can be scary like a horror movie; it can be something totally unexpected.

Let’s build some apps to put a few “bytes” into Fright Night!

Apps must use [Convex][sponsor] as part of the build. 


## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [Learn With Jason Discord](https://lwj.dev/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://lwj.dev/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
</Aside>

Find an accountabilibuddy, get expert guidance from the industry professionals, run your idea past Jason and other community members, and listen in to what the rest of the community is cooking up in this open call to kick off the hackathon.

RSVP to add it to your calendar:

  ¹ The time limit is intended to make this a quick project that can fit most schedules. That being said, if you decide to spend more time on this, we'll never let a silly thing like rules stand in the way of a good time.
