## Give in to your worst developer urges and automate something unnecessary

As developers, we all know the urge to spend hours automating a task that would have taken us minutes is overpowering. In this challenge, we want you to give in to that urge and automate something in your life that you find mildly inconvenient.

Why _do_ a thing when you could spend an inordinate amount of time building an app that does the thing _for you_? No task is too small. No inconvenience too minor. We want to see you create apps that automate your life in extremely specific, personal ways.

Do you have to send that one friend a reminder text to make sure they show up on time for your plans? Build an app for that! Sick of doing tech support for your family? Create an AI agent that reads the manual and responds on your behalf. You can keep it simple and practical, or go big and channel your inner Rube Goldberg — anything goes!

## The Sponsor: Intuit

**[Intuit][sponsor] wants to empower the builders in our community. There’s no required tool this time around — *you* are the secret ingredient here.**

Combine your skills in web development, problem solving, creative thinking, and leveraging new technologies like AI agents or MCP to build your personal problem-solving web app.

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [CodeTV Discord](https://codetv.link/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://codetv.link/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
