## Build an app that uses something other than a keyboard and mouse to control it

**Build an app using unconventional inputs. Voice commands, gestures, facial expressions — anything other than the traditional keyboard and mouse.**

The way we interact with apps is changing, and our users expect apps to adapt to their needs and intentions. The days of scouring through dozens of static pages and opening multiple tabs from the same site to piece together the context you need are numbered.

In this challenge, we want you to push the boundaries of this experience by eliminating the option of a keyboard and mouse. How could people use a web app with alternative inputs? Get creative and show us what you’ve got!

## The Tool: codename goose

**Your app must use [codename goose](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/quickstart) as part of the build.** Goose is an extensible, open source AI framework for software developers that specializes in automating dev-related tasks.

In this challenge, the Goose team wants you to spin up a team of specialized [codename goose subagents](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/experimental/subagents) to handle specific tasks.

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [CodeTV Discord](https://codetv.link/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://codetv.link/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!

## The first 5 devs to submit a qualifying app get their choice of gear

The first 5 qualifying apps submitted will receive an item of their choice, up to $150 value, from one of the following sites:
