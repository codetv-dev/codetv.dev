## Build an app that’s about breakfast

**It’s the most important ~~meal~~ app of the day! Build an app that is somehow related to breakfast.**

Manage your favorite recipes, track the best breakfast burritos, build a digital shrine to pancakes — we don’t care what you build as long as it has something to do with breakfast.

## The Tool: Hashbrown

**Your app must use Hashbrown as part of the build.**

[Hashbrown](http://codetv.link/hashbrown) allows developers to create generative UIs using your own components. It’s fully free and open source, released under the MIT license.

With Hashbrown, developers can [provide a set of custom components](https://hashbrown.dev/docs/react/concept/components) with a clear schema, and use that to give your LLM guardrails for outputting generative — but quality controlled! — user interfaces that adapt to meet the needs of your users.

You’ve also got access to [safe function calling](https://hashbrown.dev/docs/react/concept/functions), [structured output](https://hashbrown.dev/docs/react/concept/structured-output)s, and a [JavaScript Runtime](https://hashbrown.dev/docs/angular/concept/runtime), which open up some pretty interesting opportunities within apps.

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [CodeTV Discord](https://codetv.link/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://codetv.link/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
