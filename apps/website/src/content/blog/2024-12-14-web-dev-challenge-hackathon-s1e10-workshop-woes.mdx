## The prompt: The holidays are upon us and Santa’s elves are behind schedule! Build an app to get the holiday back on track.

Santa’s workshop is in chaos. The drop on the 25th is getting closer by every hour, every day  You’ve been brought in as a consultant to help get things back in order. Your job: decide what the cause of the chaos is — then plan and build an app to solve the problem.

The team at Sanity will provide us with a starter dataset and schema giving us some information about Santa’s workshop and content for all the kids in the world (the good, bad, young and old ones) — things like the staff, the inventory, services, etc. — and you can extend or modify that schema as you see fit (or, if you prefer, ignore it entirely and do something else).

Apps must use [Sanity][sponsor] as part of the build. 

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [Learn With Jason Discord](https://lwj.dev/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://lwj.dev/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
</Aside>

Find an accountabilibuddy, get expert guidance from the industry professionals, run your idea past Jason and other community members, and listen in to what the rest of the community is cooking up in this open call to kick off the hackathon.

RSVP to add it to your calendar:
