## Build an app that connects us to the physical world

So much of the software out there today seems to be reducing our connections — we talk to fewer people, have fewer reasons to go outside, etc. — so let’s build apps that help connect us to the physical world.

Face-to-face. IRL. Meatspace. Between no-contact deliveries and every AI app trying to replace another human relationship — from pair programming to therapy to romantic partners — it feels like so much of the technology being produced right now is designed to minimize, or even eliminate, our need to interact with other humans.

Let’s do our small part to change that. Your challenge is to build an app that encourages people to connect with the physical world and/or each other.

What helps you disconnect from the digital firehose and spend time making offline connections? Go in whatever direction inspires you, whether that’s a hobby, different ways to spend time together with other people, connecting to nature, or something completely different.

Your app should help ground your users and reconnect them to the world beyond their screens.

## The Tool: Apollo Connectors

**Your app must use [Apollo Connectors](https://www.apollographql.com/graphos/apollo-connectors) as part of the build.**

[Apollo][sponsor] has been helping developers build flexible APIs via GraphQL since the early days of the technology, and Connectors make it possible to bring any REST API into GraphQL quickly and painlessly. This is exciting because it means you can extend your own data with third-party API data (or vice versa) to build out anything you can imagine without a lot of data plumbing hassle.

For this challenge, you’ll have access to a large collection of [pre-built Connectors](https://www.apollographql.com/graphos/apollo-connectors#explore) for everything from Pokémon to Stripe data to LLM providers like Anthropic and OpenAI. You can also quickly hook up your own REST APIs to a custom Connector.

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [CodeTV Discord](https://codetv.link/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://codetv.link/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
