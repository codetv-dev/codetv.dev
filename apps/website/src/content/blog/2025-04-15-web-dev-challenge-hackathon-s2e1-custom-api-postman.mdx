## The prompt: Build a custom API — and an app that consumes it — that makes something in your life a little more convenient.

Not every app needs to be the Next Big Thing. Sometimes you have a specific problem, challenge, or even just a pet peeve that can be solved with software. And these days, building an app that’s just for personal use is faster than ever.

For this challenge, your team needs to create a custom API that uses at least one third-party source and extends it in some way. You’ll also need to build a web app that interacts with your API. The end result should be a system that adds convenience to your life.

This could be something larger and practical, like automating something tedious you have to do over and over again (e.g. turn important incoming emails into calendar invites and/or Discord notifications), or it could be something fun and silly (e.g. use data from your wearable fitness device to calculate how many mini Snickers bars you’ve earned today).

Apps must use [Postman][sponsor] as part of the build. 

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [CodeTV Discord](https://codetv.link/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://codetv.link/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
</Aside>

Find an accountabilibuddy, get expert guidance from the industry professionals, run your idea past Jason and other community members, and listen in to what the rest of the community is cooking up in this open call to kick off the hackathon.

RSVP to add it to your calendar:

  ¹ The time limit is intended to make this a quick project that can fit most schedules. That being said, if you decide to spend more time on this, we'll never let a silly thing like rules stand in the way of a good time.
