## Build the most unhinged, Byzantine, devious, unusual video player UX you can imagine.

Programmer social media passes around intentionally bad UI designs every once in a while, and it’s both very fun and also deeply painful to see how creatively a developer can make something like a simple button hurt so much to use.

Your challenge is to embody this kind of mischievous energy and build out a truly heinous video player UX built on top of the Mux video player base. The video *must* be actually playable (though we’ll let you get creative with what “playable” means).

Apps must use [Mux][sponsor] as part of the build. 

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [CodeTV Discord](https://codetv.link/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

<Aside variant="heart">
  **A note from Jason:** don't miss out on the chance to make connections with industry pros and get hands-on feedback on your code! Opportunities like these are a chance to <a href="https://codetv.link/manufacture-luck">manufacture your own luck</a> — don't pass it up, especially if you're looking for new opportunities!
</Aside>

Find an accountabilibuddy, get expert guidance from the industry professionals, run your idea past Jason and other community members, and listen in to what the rest of the community is cooking up in this open call to kick off the hackathon.

RSVP to add it to your calendar:
